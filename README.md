# Northcoders NC-Games API

This back end API was designed using Node.js to make HTTP requests through various endpoints to a PosgreSQL database

Information contained in the database includes:

- game reviews
- game categories
- users
- user comments on reviews
- user votes on reviews

## Link to the API

This app is currently hosted by Heroku at the following link:
https://oluc94-nc-games.netlify.app/reviews

## Local Database connection

To prevent database information from being publicly available on github create two separate `.env.test` and `.env.development` files and ensure that they are both included in the `.gitignore`.
Add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment. The correct database names are `nc_games` and `nc_games_test`.
